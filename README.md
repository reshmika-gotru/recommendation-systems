# Recommendation-Systems
The Product Recommendation System is a machine learning project that uses users' browsing and purchase histories to give them with tailored product recommendations. The system analyzes user behavior and produces pertinent recommendations by using content-based filtering algorithms and collaborative filtering. This project intends to boost sales for e-commerce companies and enhance customers' overall purchasing experiences.
# Methods
# Collaborative Filtering
A technique for suggesting products to consumers based on how other users with comparable tastes have interacted with those products is called collaborative filtering.
# Content Based Filtering
A technique for suggesting products to consumers based on their past behavior and interests is called content-based filtering (CBF). This kind of recommender system analyzes item features and determines similarities between goods using machine learning.
# Hybrid Recommendation System
A framework that addresses the shortcomings of conventional recommendation methods by combining content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation systems is known as a hybrid recommendation system.
